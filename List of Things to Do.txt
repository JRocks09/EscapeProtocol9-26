Anyone can do this:

Samari:
- Find One Enemy Asset, and program movement (Can also program walk cycle too)
- Work on Title Screen, Intro Text, game over, end screen functionality >> Changing scenes 

Joseph:
- 1 complete level
- Tweaking code as needed

Isaiah:
- Timer UI and Functionality
- Fix I-Frames of damage (right now damage is calculated individually for each damage source, not altogether)
- Create condition when the player is dead and make sure the scene is reloaded properly after game over screen is cleared
    - Will be discussed on Thursday a bit more

Damon:
- Fix button visual bug
- Figure out redirecting player position relative to the spikes as well (not needed, but would nice)
- Ending screen art
- Ending Door asset (with lock on it, visually)
