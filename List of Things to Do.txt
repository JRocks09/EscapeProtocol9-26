Samari:
- Work on Title Screen, Intro Text Scene, end screen functionality >> Changing scenes

Joseph:
- Tweaking code as needed
- Switch to Good and Bad Ending scenes based on time left on timer

Isaiah:
- Timer UI and Functionality
- Fix I-Frames of damage (right now damage is calculated individually for each damage source, not altogether)

- Create game over scene that's switched to when the player dies
      - On the scene, have "GAME OVER" text and a UI button to reload the Level1 scene

Damon:
- Ending screen art >> "Okay" Ending (Beating the game, but not very fast/barely enough time left on timer)
      - Very similar to good ending, just the toilet paper looks worse
- Other art for title screen, if time allows
